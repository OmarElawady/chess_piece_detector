# Chess pieces detector

This goal of this project is to produce a model that can detect the pieces in a chess board. The target board images are the ones that might appear in a stream. The big part is to craft realistic images to train the model. Since the pieces doesn't have to be perfectly centered (the player is holding it), or it might be hovered by arrow or other noises, these noises are simulated to yield a model that generalizes well to real data.

It's currently a work in progress.
